First i created a Python file named calculator.py in VS Code.

Then Wrote separate functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Took user input for numbers and operation choice using input().

Used a while loop to keep the calculator running until the user exits.

Finally handled errors like division by zero and tested all operations.
